# Part 1: Theoretical Understanding (40%)

## 1. Short Answer Questions

### Q1: Explain the primary differences between TensorFlow and PyTorch. When would you choose one over the other?

**Primary Differences:**

1. **Computational Graph Approach:**
   - **TensorFlow**: Uses static computational graphs (define-then-run). You first define the entire computation graph, then execute it in a session.
   - **PyTorch**: Uses dynamic computational graphs (define-by-run). The graph is built on-the-fly during execution, making it more intuitive and flexible.

2. **Ease of Debugging:**
   - **TensorFlow**: Debugging can be challenging due to static graphs; requires special debugging tools.
   - **PyTorch**: Easier to debug since you can use standard Python debugging tools like pdb, as the code executes line by line.

3. **Learning Curve:**
   - **TensorFlow**: Steeper learning curve, especially for beginners due to its complexity and multiple APIs.
   - **PyTorch**: More Pythonic and intuitive, easier for Python developers to pick up.

4. **Production Deployment:**
   - **TensorFlow**: Better ecosystem for production deployment with TensorFlow Serving, TensorFlow Lite, and TensorFlow.js.
   - **PyTorch**: Improving with TorchScript and TorchServe, but traditionally weaker in production tools.

**When to Choose:**

**Choose TensorFlow when:**
- You need robust production deployment capabilities
- Working on mobile or web deployment (TensorFlow Lite, TensorFlow.js)
- You prefer a more structured, enterprise-ready framework
- Working with large-scale distributed training

**Choose PyTorch when:**
- You're doing research or prototyping
- You want more flexibility and dynamic model building
- You prefer a more intuitive, Pythonic approach
- You need easier debugging capabilities
- Working on computer vision or NLP research projects

### Q2: Describe two use cases for Jupyter Notebooks in AI development.

**Use Case 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Preprocessing**

Jupyter Notebooks excel in data exploration and preprocessing phases of AI projects:
- **Interactive visualization**: Create plots, charts, and graphs to understand data distributions, correlations, and patterns
- **Iterative analysis**: Test different data cleaning approaches, feature engineering techniques, and statistical analyses
- **Documentation**: Combine code, visualizations, and markdown explanations in a single document
- **Example**: Analyzing a dataset of customer transactions to identify patterns, outliers, and relationships before building a recommendation system

**Use Case 2: Model Prototyping and Experimentation**

Jupyter Notebooks are ideal for rapid model development and comparison:
- **Quick iterations**: Test different algorithms, hyperparameters, and architectures in separate cells
- **Results comparison**: Display model performance metrics, confusion matrices, and validation curves side-by-side
- **Collaborative research**: Share notebooks with team members to demonstrate findings and methodologies
- **Example**: Comparing different neural network architectures for image classification, testing various optimizers, and visualizing training progress in real-time

### Q3: How does spaCy enhance NLP tasks compared to basic Python string operations?

**spaCy Enhancements:**

1. **Linguistic Intelligence:**
   - **Basic Python**: Only handles text as sequences of characters
   - **spaCy**: Understands linguistic structures (sentences, tokens, parts of speech, syntactic dependencies)

2. **Advanced Tokenization:**
   - **Basic Python**: `split()` method breaks on whitespace, missing punctuation handling
   - **spaCy**: Intelligent tokenization that handles contractions, punctuation, and language-specific rules

3. **Named Entity Recognition (NER):**
   - **Basic Python**: No built-in capability to identify entities
   - **spaCy**: Automatically identifies and classifies entities (persons, organizations, locations, dates)

4. **Part-of-Speech Tagging:**
   - **Basic Python**: Cannot determine grammatical roles of words
   - **spaCy**: Provides detailed POS tags and morphological analysis

5. **Semantic Understanding:**
   - **Basic Python**: No understanding of word relationships or meanings
   - **spaCy**: Offers word vectors, similarity calculations, and semantic relationships

6. **Language Models:**
   - **Basic Python**: No pre-trained models
   - **spaCy**: Comes with pre-trained models for multiple languages with statistical accuracy

**Example Comparison:**
```python
# Basic Python approach
text = "Apple Inc. is looking at buying U.K. startup for $1 billion"
words = text.split()  # Simple splitting

# spaCy approach
import spacy
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
doc = nlp(text)
for ent in doc.ents:
    print(ent.text, ent.label_)  # Apple Inc. - ORG, U.K. - GPE, $1 billion - MONEY
```

## 2. Comparative Analysis: Scikit-learn vs TensorFlow

### Target Applications

**Scikit-learn:**
- **Classical Machine Learning**: Linear regression, logistic regression, SVM, decision trees, random forests
- **Traditional algorithms**: K-means clustering, PCA, feature selection
- **Small to medium datasets**: Typically works well with datasets that fit in memory
- **Structured data**: Excels with tabular data, feature matrices
- **Quick prototyping**: Rapid implementation of standard ML algorithms

**TensorFlow:**
- **Deep Learning**: Neural networks, CNNs, RNNs, Transformers
- **Large-scale problems**: Image recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition
- **Big data**: Designed for large datasets that may not fit in memory
- **Unstructured data**: Images, text, audio, video processing
- **Production deployment**: Scalable solutions for real-world applications

### Ease of Use for Beginners

**Scikit-learn:**
- **Highly beginner-friendly**: Consistent API across all algorithms
- **Simple workflow**: fit(), predict(), score() methods for all models
- **Extensive documentation**: Clear examples and tutorials
- **Minimal setup**: Easy installation and immediate use
- **Built-in utilities**: Preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation tools
- **Example**: 
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

**TensorFlow:**
- **Steeper learning curve**: Requires understanding of neural networks and deep learning concepts
- **More complex setup**: GPU configuration, environment setup can be challenging
- **Multiple APIs**: Keras (high-level) vs Core TensorFlow (low-level) can be confusing
- **Debugging complexity**: Error messages can be cryptic for beginners
- **Requires more background**: Understanding of backpropagation, optimization, etc.
